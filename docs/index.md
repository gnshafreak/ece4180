# Spring '23 Final Project - HarmonECE

## Madeline Belew, Noah Horton, Gabriel Shafiq

### Project Summary

Our project is both a harmonizer and a tuner that uses different components we became familiar with over the course of the semester. It listens for an input frequency on the microphone, and then depending on which switches are high, plays multiple notes to complete a chord. Status, current note, and chord are all displayed on the LCD.
